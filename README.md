# FriendFinderApp

A fun little application designed to match the user up to someone who has compatible scores to them!

When submitted, an existing records with closely matching results should be returned to the user.

This app is *meant* to simulate dating apps, however I ran into several roadblocks during construction. The current is an error that I cannot quite figure out. I intend to fix this given the opportunity.
